# firstfreeRTOS
This repo will follow the "Introduction to RTOS" lessons by ShawnHymel on Digikey. I will be using a HUZZAH32 Feather (ESP32) board and the arduino ide to implement the lessons.

The lessons can be found at this [link](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/what-is-a-realtime-operating-system-rtos/28d8087f53844decafa5000d89608016).
